//Fahrenheit to celsius - simple code for simple schoolwork. I might come back to this at some point and improve it, since I'm still a newbie.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
float fahrenheit;
printf("Please enter the tempature in fahrenheits\n");
scanf("%f", &fahrenheit);
float celsius = (fahrenheit-32)*5/9;
printf("\n%.2f fahrenheit in celsius would be %f.2\n", fahrenheit, celsius);
return 0;

//As I said, I'm still very inexperienced and there could probably be improvements to this code. I might have added something useless in there but it works
